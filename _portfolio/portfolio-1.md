The LasVSim simulator deveploped by iDLab is a autonomous driving simulator with large scale random traffic flow. LasVSim contains multiple maps (highway, intersection, roundabout, complex urben scenario), and can be used to generate training data for learning-based decision and control algorithms, or evaluating existing decision and control methods. **I am responsible for the development of the rendering interface.**
