Hi! I'm Haitong Ma(马海铜). I am a master student of Tsinghua University advised by [Prof. Shengbo Eben Li](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/272.html) and [Prof. Sifa Zheng](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/356.html) at [Intelligent Driving Lab (iDLab)](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/). I received my Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2019.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, safe exploration, autonomous driving, and optimal control. My publications mainly focus on building safe or constrained RL algorithms for real-world safety-critical tasks with both prior model and total model-free methods. I also have some experience on applying reinforcement learning on the decision and control systems of autonomous vehicles. I did several internships at HKUST autonomous driving lab, and Tsinghua Suzhou autonomous research institute.
