I am a master student advised by [Prof. Shengbo Eben Li](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/272.html) and [Prof. Sifa Zheng](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/356.html) at [Intelligent Driving Lab (iDLab)](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/), Tsinghua University. I received my Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2019.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, safe exploration, autonomous driving, and optimal control. My publications mainly focus on building state-of-the-art safety standard and solid safety guarantee for reinforcement learning with both prior model and total model-free methods. I also have some experience on applying reinforcement learning on the decision and control systems of autonomous vehicles. I did several internships at HKUST autonomous driving lab, and Tsinghua Suzhou autonomous research institute.
